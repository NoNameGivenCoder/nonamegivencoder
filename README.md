### Hi there 👋, my name is NoNameGiven
#### Web, Backend, and Game Developer
Hello, I'm NoNameGiven. Ever since I was young I've always had a fascination for technology, and wondering how the video games I played worked, and functioned. 

Eventually, I learned about the Unity framework, which allowed me to unleash my creativity, making prototype after prototype. That didn't last long though, as school got in the way of that, and I had to focus on my studies.

One day, I was offered to help on a small wiki for some of my friends. That's where I gained a lot of knowledge and experience on building websites using HTML and CSS.

The website's I made were pretty boring though, and I wanted to add something more dynamic to them. That's where I discovered Javascript, *(And by extension, Node.js)*.

And that's where I am as of now. My goal in the future is to hopefully expand my knowledge on web development, and get back into game development. *(Oh, and to also be consistent with my Github commits..)*

Thank you for reading my README! 👋
